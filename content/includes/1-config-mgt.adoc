= Automation, automation, automation!

[%step]
* Reduces toil and frees precious time
* Repeatable
* Best emergency/repair tool
* Best way to avoid any malicious modification


= In Source Control

[%step]
* Visibility
* Peer review
* History 
* Versioned => Revertable

= Why should CI/CD systems be handled as a Pet ?


= Automation objectives

* Configure Jenkins
** efficiently
** repeatably
** consistantly

= Use cases
[%step]
* **Provision** (bootstrap) new CI/CD cluster
* **Update** the system
** ex: add a new master, change a setting, add a plugin

= Other automation objectives

[%step]
* Properly document the system
* Peer-review mechanism for configuration changes
** Keep the audit/compliance people happy
* Easily manage very large CI/CD cluster
* support CI/CD power users
** behind the scene warranty for creativity

= Configuration Management philosophies

= Golden Image
* in the early days (90s and Y2K)
* on CDs or Tapes
** a lot of work to maintain
** messy
** "one size fits nobody"


= Configuration Scripting
* Scripts solved a lot of these problems
** added
*** readability
*** versioning
* At first ad hoc (bash) scripting
* then Chef, Puppet, Ansible, etc.

= Golden Image revisited
* EC2 AMIs (Packer)
* Docker/Containers
** Golden Image new momentum
** very short start time
*** image definition description files (dockerfiles)
*** particularly adapted to the Cloud scheduler (ex K8S)


= But no silver bullet
** reality lies between
*** generalization (general purpose images)
*** need for fine grained customizations to adapt to the local constrains
