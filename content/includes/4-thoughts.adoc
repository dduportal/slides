= Some thoughts

= Thoughts (1)

[%step]
* AUTOMATE! (especially in a Cloud World)
* "CasC" is the way to go ... 
* Plugins installation !
* Bootstrapping is not solved yet
** But not a reason not to start now


= Thoughts (2)

[%step]
* Exercise your system (drift...)
//[%step]
//** the less used, the more painful
//** configuration "drift" is your enemy 
* all config changes must be done via source & automation
* Cut the access to that administration UI  ðŸ‘ˆ

= And a last one ðŸ˜‰

[%step]
* Self-Service portals...
** very 2010
** why not ask for a configuration PR?
