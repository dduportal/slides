== Automation, automation, automation!

[%step]
* Frees precious time
* Repeatable
* Best emergency/repair tool
* Best way to avoid any malicious modification


== In Source Control

[%step]
* Visibility
* Peer review
* History 
* Versioned => Revertable

== Why should CI/CD systems be handled as a Pet ?


== Automation objectives

[%step]
* Provision new CI/CD cluster (or major components)
[%step]
** efficiently
** repeatably
** consistant
* Update the system
** ex: change a setting, add a plugin

== Automation objectives

[%step]
* Peer-review mechanism for configuration changes
** Keeps the audit/compliance team happy
* Easily manage very large CI/CD cluster
* Properly document the system
* support CI/CD power users
** behind the scene warranty for creativity

== Configuration Management philosophies

== Golden Image
* in the early days
** a lot of work to maintain
** messy
** "one size fits nobody"


== Configuration Scripting
* Scripts solved a lot of these problems
** added
*** readability
*** versioning
* At first ad hoc (bash) scripting
* then Chef, Puppet, Ansible, etc.

== Golden Image revisited
* Docker/Containers
** Golden Image new momentum
** very short start time
*** image definition description files (dockerfiles)
*** particularly adapted to the Cloud scheduler (ex K8S)

== But no silver bullet
** reality lies between
*** generalization (general purpose images)
*** need for fine grained customizations to adapt to the local constrains
