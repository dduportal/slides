== Direct file System manipulation

[%step]
* classical way to configure a system
* copying/updating files on the file system (JENKINS_HOME)
* Typical Ansible modules.
** copy
** template
** lineinfile
** xml

== File system vector: Pro

* easy/natural for tools like Ansible

== File system vector: Con

* lot of reverse engineering required
* stability of these undocumented configuration is not guaranteed.
** particularly plugins configuration


== Command Line Interfaces
* two types
** REST API
** Jenkins CLI


== REST API

* using HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST "<jekinsURL>/testProject/build" --user jmm:<password|token>
----

== REST API - CSRF protection
* be aware of CSRF protection (should be on, isn't it?)
** session highjacking 
** requires a token or "crumb" when using password
** not required when using an API Token

== REST API

* To learn more:
** https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API
** https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Authenticating+scripted+clients

== Jenkins CLI

* Traditional way, via the `jenkins-cli.jar`
* To list the very functions list (dependant of installed plugin):
** view it in "Manage Jenkins -> Jenkins CLI"
** or simply use "help" CLI command.

== Jenkins CLI - Classic

{nbsp} +

[source,bash]
----
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -http -s $JENKINS_URL -auth $USERNAME:$API_token command ...
----

{nbsp} +

Much better:
[source,bash]
----
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -http -s $JENKINS_URL -auth @FILE command ...
----

== Jenkins CLI - SSH

* A simple SSH can also be used. 
* Requires to enable the build-in SSH server and assign a port
** watch your firewalls and reverse proxy

{nbsp} +

[source,bash]
----
ssh -l jmm -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p 10200 my-jenkins-server help
----

== Summary

[%step]
* Rich set of API
* Easy to use in Ansible for example
* Initial user and credential is a tough problem to solve
** SSH authentication can be automated
* CLI does a better job at controlling parameter
* CLI makes blocking calls
* CLI commands are better documented
* Parsing results is tricky

== Recommendation

* Use CLI
* Use CLI with SSH if you can (networking)
* Consider executing commands from target host.

== Groovy Scripts

[%step]
* Richest way to configure Jenkins
** Taps into Jenkins native language 
* Need developer skills 
* Documentation not easy to find
** See this link:https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/228175367-Custom-Plugins-APIs-and-Javadocs-of-CloudBees-Jenkins-Enterprise-plugins[_Knowledge Base article_,window=_blank] on how to access the javadocs
* Make them indempotent !

== How to use Groovy Script

[%step]
* via the script console
* at startup, as init-script
** placed in `$JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/`
** executed in lexical order
* via the CLI

== Groovy Scripts from the CLI

[source,bash]
----
cat my_script.groovy | {{ CLI_command }} groovy =
