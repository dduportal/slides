## Talk Summary

In the true DevOps spirit, it is a sound and recommended practice to be able to automatically (re)install and configure a Jenkins CI/CD infrastructure.

This talk will discuss the reasons and goals of such a strategy, the available vectors (file system manipulations, Rest API, CLI, JCasC) and the recommended best practices. We will explain the various common use cases and illustrate them with Ansible examples (easily converted to other popular config management tools). Although the examples will deal mainly with CloudBees Core for Traditional Platforms, the discussions can easily be extended to Jenkins, CloudBees Jenkins Distribution or CloudBees Core for Cloud Platforms.

Based on this talk, you will return with practical solutions to common problems, best practices and "tips & tricks" to implement your own strategy.
